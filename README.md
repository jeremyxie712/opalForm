# opalForm
This repository holds all the codes that are related to the development of Opal. 
My project is to design and develop a certain feature named "FORMCOMPLETE" that fills the PDF form automatically with the information we have queried from the OpalDB. The file pdf_parse.py was specifically designed to target this job.
